# My Grade Book (Team LD^3)

Our app provides a simple streamline user experience for teachers who need a place to input their students grade and assignment data and add new assignments and then grade them. 

## The User Experience

### Landing Page - Class Overview
This view provides a brief overview of the current student's grades, as well as a graphical representation of the overall grade for each student.
A link to each student's detailed grades is accessible, and will populate the student's grades when navigating to the next page.

### Student's Grades
This page allows the user to select a student to view and modify all grades. This student info is automatically passed when the student is selected from the landing page.

### View Assignments
This page displays all the current assignments, as well as the option to modify any of the data for the assignments. From this page, the teacher can grades all students for any given assignment.

### Grade Assignments
This page allows the teacher to grade each student for a given assignment. The current grade for the assignment is populated when the page loads (which is default to 0 when the has not been entered yet).
